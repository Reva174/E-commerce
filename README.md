# E-commerce

## Milestone 1
Overview: We are going to build an e-commerce website using MERN stack.
M- MongoDb used for database
E- Express used for building of servers
R- React used for building of UI for project
N- Nodejs used for setting up of backend
Through this project, we'll be getting the understanding of how to build a project from scratch.

## Milestone 2: Frontend and Backend Setup
Frontend Setup
Initialize the frontend using the following commands and packages:

Tailwind CSS
React (npm create vite@latest frontend)
Backend Setup
Set up the backend with the following commands and packages:

Initialize Node.js project: npm init or npm init -y
Express: npm i express
Mongoose: npm i mongoose
CORS: npm i cors
Nodemon: npm i nodemon



## Milestone 3: Backend setup
In this milestone,  we have connected mongodb with our application. We have also defined the middleware, created serve and configured env.

## Milestone 4: 

In this milestone, I have created user endpoint using express and I have created a multer file which helps us to upload images to UI and store the same images in backend.
Installation of multer: npm install multer

## Milestone 5:
In this milestone, I created a signup page and validation object.

## Milestone 6:
Created a multer file for the upload functionality When we click submit button, the data will be reflected in console as a json format the images will be stored under the uploads.

## Milestone 7:
In this milestone, I created the login validation using axios if user data exist then login success.

## Milestone 8:
We learned and created reusable card component with props for product details (e.g., name, image, price). We have also setup a grid layout or flexbox for displaying multiple cards neatly.

## Milestone 9:
We Create the form for products. We have also made this form functional such that this form will take multiple product images as input.

## Milestone 10:
We have created an endpoint to create a product. We have also configured the multer to upload the multiples images of the product.

## Milestone 11:
We have created an endpoint that will send data from extract and send data from mongodb. We have also receive data at frontend and display that data dynamically using product card created earlier.

## Milestone 12:
We have created an an endpoint that will send data by filtering with mail's and send data from mongodb. We have also learned how to display that data dynamically using product card created earlier.

## Milestone 13:
We have created an an endpoint that will update the existing data in MongoDB. We have also implemented the logic of auto filling the form with previous data and give option to edit.

## Milestone 14:
We have created an endpoint that delete the product with specific ID from MongoDB.

## Milestone 15:
We have created an new Navbar with links to all pages. We have also implemented the Navbar responsive to all screen sizes.
