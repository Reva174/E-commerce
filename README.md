# E-commerce

## Milestone 1
Overview: We are going to build an e-commerce website using MERN stack.
M- MongoDb used for database
E- Express used for building of servers
R- React used for building of UI for project
N- Nodejs used for setting up of backend
Through this project, we'll be getting the understanding of how to build a project from scratch.

## Milestone 2: Frontend and Backend Setup
Frontend Setup
Initialize the frontend using the following commands and packages:

Tailwind CSS
React (npm create vite@latest frontend)
Backend Setup
Set up the backend with the following commands and packages:

Initialize Node.js project: npm init or npm init -y
Express: npm i express
Mongoose: npm i mongoose
CORS: npm i cors
Nodemon: npm i nodemon



## Milestone 3: Backend setup
In this milestone,  we have connected mongodb with our application. We have also defined the middleware, created serve and configured env.

## Milestone 4: 

In this milestone, I have created user endpoint using express and I have created a multer file which helps us to upload images to UI and store the same images in backend.
Installation of multer: npm install multer

## Milestone 5:

We have create an Backend endpoint that will sent user data. Also create frontend profile page that will display profile photo, name and email in one section. If there are no address display "No address found". In another section we have displayed address and added an button called "Add address".
